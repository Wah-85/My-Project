# My-Project

Weather Data Analysis Project
Overview
This project analyzes weather data, including rainfall, temperature, and wind speed, using Python. The goal is to automate the data handling process and visualize trends for better understanding.

Dataset
The dataset includes:

Date: Record date
Rainfall: Highest 30, 60, and 120-minute rainfall (mm)
Temperature: Maximum, minimum, and mean (Â°C)
Wind Speed: Mean and maximum (km/h)
Visualization
Using matplotlib, the data is visualized through:

Combined Plot: All parameters in one figure
Subplots: Separate visualizations for rainfall, temperature, and wind speed

How to Use
1.Clone the Repository:
  	git clone <repo-url>
  	cd weather-data-analysis
2.Install Required Libraries: Make sure you have the required Python libraries installed by running:
	pip install -r requirements.txt
3.Run the Script: Execute the Python script to generate the plots
	python plot_weather_data.py


Conclusion
This project automates weather data analysis and provides clear visual insights for use in engineering and environmental research.
